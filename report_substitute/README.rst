This module allows you to create substitution rules for report actions.
A typical use case is to replace a standard report by alternative reports
when some conditions are met. For instance, it allows to configure alternate
reports for different companies.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to 'Actions' / 'Reports'

#. Select the desired report you want to 'Substitution Rules'

#. In the substitutions page add a new line

#. Select the substitution report action

#. Set a domain to specify when this substitution should happen


When a user calls a report action, the system tries to find the first
substitution in with a domain that matches all records.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- The document name result should take the name of the substitution report.
