OCA alternative reporting engines and reporting utilities for Odoo
==================================================================

This repository hosts alternative reporting engines to the ones included on Odoo core (RML, QWeb and Webkit). It is complemented with the ones that host the reports theirself:

https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting
https://github.com/OCA/purchase-reporting
https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting
...

The convention is to use a suffix to each module to indicate that it's for using with that report engine (for example, account_invoice_report_birt or sale_order_report_pentaho).

It can contain also another utilities directly involved with reports (like merge/split utils, checkers, signing tools and so on).
