    'description' : """This repository hosts alternative reporting 
                    engines to the ones included on Odoo core (RML, QWeb and Webkit). 
                    It is complemented with the ones that host the reports theirself:

                    https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting 
                    https://github.com/OCA/purchase-reporting https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting ...

                    The convention is to use a suffix to each module to indicate 
                    that its for using with that report engine (for example, account_invoice_report_birt 
                    or sale_order_report_pentaho).

                    It can contain also another utilities directly involved 
                    with reports (like merge/split utils, checkers, signing tools and so on).""" ,
