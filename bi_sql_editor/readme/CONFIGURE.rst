To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Settings / Technical / Database Structure / SQL Views

* tip your SQL request

* Select the group(s) that could have access to the view

  .. figure:: ../static/description/02_security_access.png
     :width: 800 px

* Click on the button 'Clean and Check Request'

* Once the sql request checked, the module analyses the column of the view,
  and propose field mapping. For each field, you can decide to create an index
  and set if it will be displayed on the pivot graph as a column, a row or a
  measure.

* Click on the button 'Create SQL View, Indexes and Models'. (this step could
  take a while, if view is materialized)

* If it's a MATERIALIZED view:

    * a cron task is created to refresh
      the view. You can so define the frequency of the refresh.
    * the size of view (and the indexes is displayed)

* Finally, click on 'Create UI', to create new menu, action, graph view and
  search view.
