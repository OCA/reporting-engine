This module was written to extend the functionality of the reporting engine to
support XML reports and allow modules to generate them by code or by QWeb
templates.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

* Install lxml_ in Odoo's ``$PYTHONPATH``.
* Install the repository `reporting-engine`_.

But this module does nothing for the end user by itself, so if you have it
installed it's probably because there is another module that depends on it.

.. _reporting-engine: https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine
.. _lxml: http://lxml.de/

Usage
=====

This module is intended as a base engine for other modules to use it, so no direct result if you are a user.

If you are a developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn from an example, just check the `demo report`_ on GitHub for
the model ``res.company`` or check it in interface from companies views.

To develop with this module, you need to:

* Create a module.
* Make it depend on this one.
* Follow `instructions to create reports`_ having in mind that the
  ``report_type`` field in your ``ir.actions.report`` record must be
  ``qweb-xml``.

In case you want to create a `custom report`_, the instructions remain the same
as for HTML reports, and the method that you must override is also called
``_get_report_values``, even when this time you are creating a XML report.

You can make your custom report inherit ``report.report_xml.abstract``, name
it in such way ``report.<module.report_name>``. Also you can add a XSD file for
report validation into ``xsd_schema`` field of your report (check
`report definition`_) and have XSD automatic checking for
free.

You can customize rendering process and validation way via changing logic of
``generate_report`` and ``validate_report`` methods in your report class.

You can visit ``http://<server-address>/report/xml/<module.report_name>/<ids>``
to see your XML report online as a web page.
