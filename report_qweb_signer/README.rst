Installation
============

To install this module, you need to install Java JDK Headlees, e.g.:

  apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless

Configuration
=============

In order to start signing PDF documents you need to configure certificate(s)
to use in your company.

* Go to ``Settings > Companies > Companies > Your company``
* Go to ``Report configuration`` tab
* Click ``Edit``
* Add a new item in ``PDF report certificates`` list
* Click ``Create``
* Set name, certificate file, password file and model
* Optionally you can set a domain and filename pattern for saving as attachment

For example, if you want to sign only customer invoices in open or paid state:

* Model: ``account.invoice``
* Domain: ``[('type','=','out_invoice'), ('state', 'in', ('open', 'paid'))]``
* Save as attachment: ``(object.number or '').replace('/','_') + '.signed.pdf'``

**Note**: Linux user that executes Odoo server process must have
read access to certificate file and password file

Java Memory Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are signing large amounts of reports at the same time, or if you have a
lower worker memory size than the JVM defaults, you may need to tune the JVM
heap memory limits. Do so by adding a ``$JVM_ARGS`` environment variable that
contains the required flags. Check out these links too:

- `StackOverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14763095/1468388>`_.
- `Java docs <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15523_01/web.1111/e13814/jvm_tuning.htm#PERFM161>`_.

Usage
=====

User just prints PDF documents (only Qweb PDF reports supported) as usual,
but signed PDF is automatically downloaded if this document model is configured
as indicated above.

If 'Save as attachment' is configured, signed PDF is saved as attachment and
next time saved one is downloaded without signing again. This is appropiate
when signing date is important, for example, when signing customer invoices.

You can try the signing with the demo report that is included for customers
called "Test PDF certificate".

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* When signing multiple documents (if 'Allow only one document' is disable)
  then 'Save as attachment' is not applied and signed result is not
  saved as attachment.
* To have a visible signature through an image embedded in the resulting PDF.
* Add tests.
