This module was written to add watermarks (backgrounds) to PDF reports. Because of the way wkhtmltopdf handles headers and footers in the current versions, it is quite impossible to have a background for the complete page using HTML and CSS. That is why this module inserts the image at the PDF level.

Installation
============


As PyPDF is not supported in python3, you need to install PyPDF2::

$ pip install pypdf2

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. go to your report
#. select a PDF or image to use as watermark. Note that resolutions and size must match, otherwise you'll have funny results
#. You can also fill in an expression that returns the data (base64 encoded) to be used as watermark

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module depends on support for transparent backgrounds in Wkhtmltopdf, which has been flaky in the past. This module has been reported to work with Wkhtmltopdf 0.12.4.
