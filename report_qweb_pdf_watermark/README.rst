This module was written to add watermarks (backgrounds) to PDF reports.
Because of the way wkhtmltopdf handles headers and footers in the
current versions, it is quite impossible to have a background for the
complete page using HTML and CSS. That is why this module inserts the
image at the PDF level.

1. go to your report
2. select a PDF or image to use as watermark. Note that resolutions and
   size must match, otherwise you'll have funny results

   encoded) to be used as watermark

To use the Company watermark, you need to:

1. go to settings --> company --> update info
2. upload an pdf watermark

4. Select the report where you want to use it.
