Custom report filenames
=======================

This addon allows for custom filenames for reports.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, open the report whose filename you want to change and fill in the `Download filename` field. This field is evaluated as jinja2 template with `objects` being a list of browse records of the records to print, and `o` the first record.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * Currently, only old-style reports (ir.actions.report.xml) are supported, it should be simple to add support for qweb reports.
