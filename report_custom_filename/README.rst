Custom report filenames
=======================

This addon allows for custom filenames for reports.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, open the report whose filename you want to change and fill in the `Download filename` field. This field is evaluated as jinja2 template with `objects` being a list of browse records of the records to print, and `o` the first record. If your model contains a name field, you might write something like `${o.name}_report.pdf` as filename.
