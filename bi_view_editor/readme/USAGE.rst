To graphically design your analysis data-set:

- From the Dashboards menu, select "Custom BI Views"
- Browse trough the business objects in the Query tab
- Pick the interesting fields (Drag & Drop)
- For each selected field, right-click on the Options column and select whether it's a row, column or measure; if you want to remove the field from the list view, unflag the checkbox ´List´ in the Options column
- Save and click "Generate BI View"
- Click "Open BI View" to view the result
- If module Dashboard (board) is installed, the standard "Add to My Dashboard" functionality would be available
- Click "Create a menu" to create a new menu item directly linked to your new BI view (this feature is available in developer mode); when the BI view is reset back to draft this menu will be removed, and you will need to re-create the menu entry.
