To graphically design your analysis data-set:

- From the Dashboards menu, select "Custom BI Views"
- Browse trough the business objects in the "Query Builder" tab
- Pick the interesting fields (Drag & Drop)
- For each selected field, right-click on the Options column and select whether
  it's a row, column or measure; if you want to remove the field from the list
  view, unflag the checkbox ´List´ in the Options column
- Save and click "Generate BI View"
- Click "Open BI View" to view the result

To access the created BI View with a dedicated menu:

- If module Dashboard (board) is installed, the standard "Add to My Dashboard"
  functionality would be available
- Click "Create a menu" to create a new menu item directly linked to your new
  BI view (this feature is available in developer mode); when the BI view is
  reset back to draft this menu will be removed, and you will need to re-create
  the menu entry.

A more advanced UI is also available under the "Details" tab. It provides extra
possibilities for more advanced users, like to use LEFT JOIN instead of the
default INNER JOIN.
