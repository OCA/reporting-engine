To graphically design your analysis data-set:

- From the Dashboards menu, select "Custom BI Views"
- Browse trough the business objects in the "Query Builder" tab
- Pick the interesting fields (Drag & Drop)
- For each selected field, right-click on the Options column and select whether
  it's a row, column or measure; if you want to remove the field from the list
  view, unflag the checkbox ´List´ in the Options column
- Save and click "Generate BI View"
- Click "Open BI View" to view the result

To access the created BI View with a dedicated menu:

- If module Dashboard (board) is installed, the standard "Add to My Dashboard"
  functionality would be available
- Click "Create a menu" to create a new menu item directly linked to your new
  BI view (this feature is available in developer mode); when the BI view is
  reset back to draft this menu will be removed, and you will need to re-create
  the menu entry.

A more advanced UI is also available under the "Details" tab. It provides extra
possibilities for more advanced users, like to use LEFT JOIN instead of the
default INNER JOIN.

It also possible to improve the IDs generation for new views by adding an `Over Condition` in the "SQL" tab, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS for further details.
For instance, an ORDER BY clause helps preventing unreliable behavior when filtering the generated views.
