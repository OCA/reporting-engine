* Non-stored fields and many2many fields are not supported
* Provide graph view for table relations
* Extend the capabilities of the tree views (e.g. add sums)
* Provide a tutorial (eg. a working example of usage)
* Implement a more advanced UI, with possibilities to use LEFT JOIN as default instead of INNER JOIN
* Find better ways to extend the *_auto_init()* without override
* Possibly avoid the monkey patches
* Data the user has no access to (e.g. in a multi company situation) can be viewed by making a view
* Store the JSON data structure in ORM
* Would be nice if models available to select when creating a view are limited to the ones that have intersecting groups (for non technical users)
