BI View Editor
==============

The module BI View Editor is user-friendly tool (Query Builder) integrated in Odoo.
It creates views for Odoo 9, allowing the user to specify graphically the sources
and the attributes of the data-set to analyze, automating all the operations for
creating all the necessary low level Odoo objects.


It is intended for:

- Graphically define your analysis data-set
- Add new computed information to your data set
- Specify the visualization attributes
- Create the basis for a new data exploration method in Odoo


Benefits would be:

- More freedom to consultants or end users to customize views
- No more external tools for data analysis
- Easy update of your BI reports
- No more external tools for data analysis



Usage
=====


To graphically design your analysis data-set:

- From the Reporting menu, select "Custom BI Views"
- Browse trough the business objects in the Query tab
- Pick the interesting fields (Drag & Drop)
- Save and click "Generate BI View"
