BI View Editor is a tool integrated in Odoo that allows users define and
execute their own reports without the need to code.

Purpose:

* The BI View Editor is used to create reports not already contained in the
  standard Odoo, combining data from existing sources.

* It has been designed to be used by users with little or no knowledge of
  the technical architecture of Odoo. Users visually link business objects
  and select the fields to visualize.

* The BI View Editor offers users different types of representations,
  including tree, graph, pivot views.

Installation
============

In the Odoo configuration file add ``bi_view_editor`` in the list
``server_wide_modules``:

.. code-block:: ini

  [options]
  (...)
  server_wide_modules = web,bi_view_editor
  (...)

Alternatively specify ``--load=bi_view_editor`` when starting Odoo by command line.

Optionally it is possible to enable the view of the ER Diagram. For this you
need to install `Graphviz`, an open source graph visualization software:

.. code-block:: bash

   ``sudo apt-get install graphviz``

Usage
=====

To graphically design your analysis data-set:

- From the Dashboards menu, select "Custom BI Views"
- Browse trough the business objects in the "Query Builder" tab
- Pick the interesting fields (Drag & Drop)
- For each selected field, right-click on the Options column and select whether
  it's a row, column or measure; if you want to remove the field from the list
  view, unflag the checkbox ´List´ in the Options column
- Save and click "Generate BI View"
- Click "Open BI View" to view the result

To access the created BI View with a dedicated menu:

- If module Dashboard (board) is installed, the standard "Add to My Dashboard"
  functionality would be available
- Click "Create a menu" to create a new menu item directly linked to your new
  BI view (this feature is available in developer mode); when the BI view is
  reset back to draft this menu will be removed, and you will need to re-create
  the menu entry.

A more advanced UI is also available under the "Details" tab. It provides extra
possibilities for more advanced users, like to use LEFT JOIN instead of the
default INNER JOIN.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Non-stored fields and many2many fields are not supported.
* Provide a tutorial (eg. a working example of usage).
* Find better ways to extend the *_auto_init()* without override.
* Possibly avoid the monkey patches.
* Data the user has no access to (e.g. in a multi company situation) can be
  viewed by making a view. Would be nice if models available to select when
  creating a view are limited to the ones that have intersecting groups.
