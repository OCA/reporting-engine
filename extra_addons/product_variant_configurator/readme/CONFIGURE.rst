(after installing `sale_management` application)

To configure the creation of the variants behaviour, you need to:

#. Go to ``Sales > Configuration > Settings``, and select "Attributes and
   Variants (Set product attributes (e.g. color, size) to sell variants)" on
   "Product Catalog" section.
#. Go to ``Sales > Catalog > Products``, and select a product.
#. On the Variants tab edit the value of the field ``Variant Creation``.
#. If you want to stop the automatic creation of the variant, and have the same
   behaviour for all the products in the same category, go to ``Inventory >
   Configuration > Product Categories``, select the category and check the checkbox
   ``Don't create variants automatically``.
