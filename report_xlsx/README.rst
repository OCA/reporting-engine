        def generate_xlsx_report(self, workbook, data, partners):
            for obj in partners:
                report_name = obj.name
                # One sheet by partner
                sheet = workbook.add_worksheet(report_name[:31])
                bold = workbook.add_format({'bold': True})
                sheet.write(0, 0, obj.name, bold)
