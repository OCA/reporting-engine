This module allows administrators to define the decimal precision of

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo's QWeb reports display values of float fields based on the decimal
accuracy settings, which are global and sometimes bring inconveniences.

For example:

-  You have some products which require a fine precision with inventory
   management (e.g. liquid, powder, etc.) and you set 'Product Unit of
   Measure' to 4, but you don't want to show '2.0000 Units' on your
   quotation to sell assembled products (you may just want to show '2
   Units').
-  You purchase some raw materials in bulk in USD whose unit price comes
   down to the 4th decimal place and you set 'Product Price' to this
   level or precision, but you don't want to show the unit price of a
   product as '120,000.0000' on your JPY quotation (you would just want
   to show '120,000').

This module is designed to address these inconveniences.

Configuration
=============

Go to *Settings > Technical > Reporting > Decimal Precision QWeb*, and
create records according to your needs.

For each record:

-  choose a model and a float-type field (required)
-  set UoM and UoM Field, or Currency and Currency Field (optional)
-  set Company (optional)
-  set Digits (required)

Usage
=====

Print a QWeb report (quotation, invoice, purchase order, etc.), and the
value presentation for fields like line quantity and price unit are
adjusted according to the Decimal Precision QWeb configuration.

Note that among matching config records, the one with the strictest
condition will be adopted.
