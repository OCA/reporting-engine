   :local:

Configuration
=============

Go to **Settings > Technical > Analysis > Label Paper Format** and create
your self-adhesive label paper formats.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/reporting-engine/14.0/report_label/static/description/configure_paperformat.png

You'll need to create or reuse a QWeb template for you label.

`By design <https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/blob/14.0/report_label/reports/report_label.xml#L34>`_, the variable used in this QWeb template must be named `record`.

Go to **Settings > Technical > Analysis > Label Report** and create your label
report, and its context action.

Usage
=====

1. In the target model's tree view, select the records to print.
2. Click *Action* and your label report action name.
3. Select the number of labels per record to print, and click Print.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Known issues:

* `wkhtmltopdf` doesn't always respect dpi, and mm measures don't match. For
  this matter, it's recommended to use this module along with
  `report_wkhtmltopdf_param` and enable `--disable-smart-shrinking`.

* This module depends on `base_automation` only because this module extends
  `ir.actions.server` with a new kind of action, and `base.automation` inherits
  from `ir.actions.server` by delegation in such a way that the modules cannot
  be loaded in another order.
