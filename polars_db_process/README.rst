From a db query, this module allows to transform data in Polars
dataframe and process them according to rules in order to:

-  filter data and display
-  obtain another dataframe with only the expected data to use in Odoo

A such dataframe can help to prepare data in order to be used to
create/update or import

For that you need to transform/arrange data to the same way

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
