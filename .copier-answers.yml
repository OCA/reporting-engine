repo_description: 'This repository hosts alternative reporting engines to the ones
  included on Odoo core (RML, QWeb and Webkit).


  The convention is to use a suffix to each module to indicate that it''s for using
  with that report engine (for example, account_invoice_report_birt or sale_order_report_pentaho).


  It can contain also another utilities directly involved with reports (like merge/split
  utils, checkers, signing tools and so on).'
