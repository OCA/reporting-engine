Configuration
=============

In case the exported report should be encoded in another system than UTF-8, following
fields of the report record (*Settings > Technical > Reports*) should be populated accordingly.

* Text Encoding: set an encoding system (such as cp932)
* Text Encode Error Handling: select 'Ignore' or 'Replace' as necessary.
  * 'Ignore': in case of an encoding error, the problematic character will be removed from the exported file.
  * 'Replace': in case of an encoding error, the problematic character will be replaced with '?' symbol.
  * Leaving the field blank: in case of an encoding error, the report generation fails with an error message.
* Line Ending: Select the type of line ending, 'CRLF' or 'CR', as necessary.
  * 'CRLF': 'Carriage Return' + 'Line Feed' (Windows)
  * 'CR': 'Carriage Return' (classic Mac OS)
  * Leaving this field blank defaults to using 'LF' (Line Feed), the default behavior of Odoo.
