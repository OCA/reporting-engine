==========================================
Py3o Report Engine - Fusion server support
==========================================

This module was written to let a py3o fusion server handle format conversion instead of local libreoffice.

Installation
============

Install several additional components and Python libs:

* `Py3o Fusion server <https://bitbucket.org/faide/py3o.fusion>`_,
* `Py3o render server <https://bitbucket.org/faide/py3o.renderserver>`_,
* a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which can be OpenJDK,
* Libreoffice started in the background in headless mode,
* the Java driver for Libreoffice (Juno).

It is also possible to use the Python driver for Libreoffice (PyUNO), but it is recommended to use the Java driver because it is more stable.

The installation procedure below uses the Java driver. It has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ; if you use another OS, you may have to change a few details.

Installation of py3o.fusion:

.. code::

  pip install py3o.fusion
  pip install service-identity

Installation of py3o.renderserver:

.. code::

  pip install py3o.renderserver

Installation of Libreoffice and JRE on Debian/Ubuntu:

.. code::

  sudo apt-get install default-jre ure libreoffice-java-common libreoffice-writer

You may have to install additionnal fonts. For example, to have the special unicode symbols for phone/fax/email in the PDF reports generated by Py3o, you should install the following package:

.. code::

  sudo apt-get install fonts-symbola

At the end, with the dependencies, you should have the following py3o python libs:

.. code::

  % pip freeze | grep py3o
  py3o.formats==0.3
  py3o.fusion==0.8.7
  py3o.renderclient==0.2
  py3o.renderers.juno==0.8
  py3o.renderserver==0.5.1
  py3o.template==0.9.11
  py3o.types==0.1.1

Start the Py3o Fusion server:

.. code::

  start-py3o-fusion --debug -s localhost

Start the Py3o render server:

.. code::

  start-py3o-renderserver --java=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so --ure=/usr/share --office=/usr/lib/libreoffice --driver=juno --sofficeport=8997

On the output of the Py3o render server, the first line looks like:

.. code::

  DEBUG:root:Starting JVM: /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so with options: -Djava.class.path=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/py3o/renderers/juno/py3oconverter.jar:/usr/share/java/juh.jar:/usr/share/java/jurt.jar:/usr/share/java/ridl.jar:/usr/share/java/unoloader.jar:/usr/share/java/java_uno.jar:/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/classes/unoil.jar -Xmx150M

After **-Djava.class.path**, there is a list of Java libs with *.jar* extension ; check that each JAR file is really present on your filesystem. If one of the jar files is present in another directory, create a symlink that points to the real location of the file. If all the jar files are present on another directory, adapt the *--ure=* argument on the command line of Py3o render server.

To check that the Py3o Fusion server is running fine, visit the URL http://<IP_address>:8765/form. On this web page, under the section *Target format*, make sure that you have a line *This server currently supports these formats: ods, odt, docx, doc, html, docbook, pdf, xls.*.
